==========

A utility for exporting all that is precious from your Mac, with the goal of transferring it to a new Mac.

Inspired by Mark Strand's poem ["The Remains"](http://www.ludlowpress.com/strand_mark.htm):

The Remains
=====

```
I empty myself of the names of others. I empty my pockets.
I empty my shoes and leave them beside the road.
At night I turn back the clocks;
I open the family album and look at myself as a boy.

What good does it do? The hours have done their job.
I say my own name. I say goodbye.
The words follow each other downwind.
I love my wife but send her away.

My parents rise out of their thrones
into the milky rooms of clouds. How can I sing?
Time tells me what I am. I change and I am the same.
I empty myself of my life and my life remains.
```
