I empty my pockets.\r\nI empty my shoes and leave them beside the road.\r\nAt night I turn back the clocks;\r\nI open the family album and look at myself as a boy.\r\n\r\nWhat good does it do? The hours have done their job.\r\nI say my own name. I say goodbye.\r\nThe words follow each other downwind.\r\nI love my wife but send her away.\r\n\r\nMy parents rise out of their thrones\r\ninto the milky rooms of clouds. How can I sing?\r\nTime tells me what I am. I change and I am the same.\r\nI empty myself of my life and my life remains.\r\n```","google":"UA-8001150-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
